<h2 style="white-space:pre-wrap;">GENERAL GUIDELINES &amp; THOUGHTS ABOUT REMOTE INSTRUCTION</h2>
<p class="" style="white-space:pre-wrap;"><strong> </strong>As you plan for Fall, it may be helpful to plan with asynchronous components in mind.&nbsp; What mix of synchronous and asynchronous are you comfortable with for your course?&nbsp; Well-designed asynchronous activities can help address students’ need for flexibility, their desire for connection, and “zoom-fatigue,” while also creating opportunities for meaningful self-directed learning.&nbsp;</p>
<p class="" style="white-space:pre-wrap;"> Consider questions such as:&nbsp; what must be taught (or is best taught) synchronously?&nbsp; What parts of the course might be prepared as self-directed or group-directed asynchronous activities and assignments using the LMS or other tools at your disposal?&nbsp; </p>
<p class="" style="white-space:pre-wrap;">In remote instruction of any kind remember that time takes on new meaning.&nbsp; Zoom-fatigue is real and we all will get tired of staring at screens and feel a bit isolated.&nbsp; </p>
<p class="" style="white-space:pre-wrap;">As mentioned above, research on learning suggests that it has multiple dimensions—Cognitive, Social, and Emotional (Chris Jernstedt, SEPCHE Faculty Development Day).&nbsp; We need to try to engage all three as best as possible.&nbsp; What does this look like?</p>
<ul>
	<li><p class="" style="white-space:pre-wrap;"><strong>Develop an authentic online/remote teaching presence.</strong>&nbsp; The modality is stilted, but you don’t have to be.&nbsp; Remember to be human, make jokes, communicate your personality and your care for the students even in the remote format.</p></li>
	<li><p class="" style="white-space:pre-wrap;"><strong>Keep the students connected to you through regular, predictable</strong> communication pattern and through targeted emails to students who may be struggling.&nbsp; </p></li
		><li><p class="" style="white-space:pre-wrap;"><strong>Consider holding regular, virtual office hours where students</strong> can just “drop in” to chat with you.&nbsp; Remind students with a notice via email and on Canvas announcement about an hour before you go “live.”</p></li>
		<li><p class="" style="white-space:pre-wrap;"><strong>Empathize with students.</strong>&nbsp; Try to understand how students (and how you) experience the disruption—practically, socially, emotionally.&nbsp; Consider being a bit more flexible with students who are struggling.&nbsp; Work to keep them engaged through personal outreach.</p></li>
		<li><p class="" style="white-space:pre-wrap;"><strong>Imagine the course experience from the students’ perspective at least once a week</strong>—how are they experiencing what they are doing?&nbsp; Are you making the connections between content and activities as clear to them as it is to you! If you are concerned that you may be giving them too much work, try this <a href="https://cte.rice.edu/workload">Coursework Calculator</a> from Rice University.</p></li>
		<li><p class="" style="white-space:pre-wrap;"><strong>Seek student feedback on workload and progress.</strong>&nbsp; Encourage students to let you know if they are finding the workload overwhelming or if they haven’t understood a concept.  It helps if you have a defined way for them to do this—a discussion board or the Q &amp; A section of Canvas, a communication spot reserved for this purpose.</p></li>
		<li><p class="" style="white-space:pre-wrap;"><strong>Connect students to each other.&nbsp; </strong>Try to find ways to engage the students with each other even when working remotely through simulated group work.</p>
			<ul data-rte-list="default"><li><p class="" style="white-space:pre-wrap;"> Have students do peer review on Canvas</p>
			</li>
				<li><p class="" style="white-space:pre-wrap;">As students to collaborate on documents and presentations on Canvas</p></li>
				<li><p class="" style="white-space:pre-wrap;">Encourage students meet in small groups through breakout rooms on Canvas or Teams during a synchronous class</p></li>
				<li><p class="" style="white-space:pre-wrap;">Encourage students working in a group to meet synchronously to get work done together without you present</p></li>
				<li><p class="" style="white-space:pre-wrap;">Connect students to peer-tutors and the learning centers for additional help and to provide an additional sense of connection.</p></li>
			</ul></li>
			<li><p class="" style="white-space:pre-wrap;"> <strong>Connect with what’s going on in the wider world. Reinforce the relevance of what you’re teaching and student’s motivation for learning. This also gives students critical practice in observing, reflecting and applying what they’re learning.</strong></p></li>
			<li><p class="" style="white-space:pre-wrap;"><strong>Safeguard your own mental health and well-being</strong>.&nbsp; It is easy to work all the time; set boundaries for yourself and respect them.&nbsp;Set predictable times when you will be “present” in the course—even if it is asynchronous—the time you might work on discussion board posts, watch student video presentations, hold virtual office hours, etc.</p></li>
